		"title": "Can a \"regular home\" furnace be installed in a mobile home?",
		"text": "Yes, you can install a \"regular home furnace\" in a mobile home but there are some things you need to take into consideration. The spot where you install the furnace needs to have sufficient air for combustion & proper clearance to combustibles (walls, ceiling and floor) this will depend on the model you choose. You also need to be aware of venting requirements. If you have limited space and plan on putting your furnace in a confined area then a furnace that draws combustion air from outside will probably work best. I should also mention that some units are designated, as \"not for use in a mobile home\" so of course these units would not be suitable.",
